# Introduction

The idea is to become significantly faster by using only your keyboard.  
There's even a tool for browsing the web with only a keyboard using Vim-style keys: the **Vimium** browser extension.  

## Personal Note

For Firefox with heavy YouTube and GitHub use, **Vimium C** is usually the better fit because of its per-site mappings and more advanced config, 
which helps avoid conflicts with built-in shortcuts on those sites.

## Forget about Arrow keys

- H is for moving left
- J is for moving down
- K is for moving up
- L is for moving right

>[!tip]
>You should keep both hands on the keyboard in a position where your index fingers are touching the small guides on J and F.

## Basics

- Vim starts in NORMAL mode.
- To enter **INSERT** mode and start editing, you need to press the **i** key.
- To get out of insert mode and back to normal, you must press **Esc**.
- Pressing **A** is another way to drop into **insert** mode but going in the direction of the writing
