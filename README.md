# Introduction

The idea is to become significantly faster by using only your keyboard.  
There's even a tool for browsing the web with only a keyboard using Vim-style keys: the **Vimium** browser extension.  

## Personal Note

For Firefox with heavy YouTube and GitHub use, **Vimium C** is usually the better fit because of its per-site mappings and more advanced config, 
which helps avoid conflicts with built-in shortcuts on those sites.

# Forget about Arrow keys

- The **h** is for moving **left**
- The **j** is for moving **down**
- The **k** key is for moving **up**
- The **l** key is for moving **right** (lower case L)

>[!tip]
>You should keep both hands on the keyboard in a position where your **index fingers** are touching the **small guides on J and F**.

# Basics

- Vim starts in **NORMAL** mode.
- To enter **INSERT** mode and start editing, you need to press the **i** key.
- To get out of insert mode and back to normal, you must press **Esc**.
- Pressing **a** is another way to drop into **insert** mode but moves your cursor one character to the right
- The **I** key enters insert mode and moves your cursor at the beginning of the line
- The **A** key enters insert mode and moves your cursor at the end of the line
- The **w** key moves your cursor to the next word
