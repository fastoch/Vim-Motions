# Introduction

The idea is to become significantly faster by using only your keyboard.  
There's even a tool for browsing the web with only a keyboard using Vim-style keys: the **Vimium** browser extension.  

## Personal Note

For Firefox with heavy YouTube and GitHub use, **Vimium C** is usually the better fit because of its per-site mappings and more advanced config, 
which helps avoid conflicts with built-in shortcuts on those sites.
